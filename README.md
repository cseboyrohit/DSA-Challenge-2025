_______________________________________________________________________________  

Day 5 & 6 Arrays & Hashing (Intermediate Problems)
Here are your 4 problems for Day 3. These problems will strengthen your understanding of arrays and hashing concepts:

1.Group Anagrams

Difficulty: Medium
Use a hash map to group strings that are anagrams of each other.
Encode and Decode Strings

2.Encode and Decode Strings

Difficulty: Medium
Learn how to encode a list of strings into a single string and decode it back.
Longest Consecutive Sequence

3.Longest Consecutive Sequence

Difficulty: Medium
Use a set to find the longest sequence of consecutive integers in an unsorted array.
Valid Sudoku

4.Valid Sudoku
Difficulty: Medium
Check if a Sudoku board configuration is valid using hashing for rows, columns, and grids.

Day 7: Arrays & Two Pointers 
Today, we’ll focus on problems that help you practice **two-pointer techniques**, a foundational concept in DSA.

1. *[Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Rearrange the array such that all zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.  

2. *[Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Use the two-pointer technique to find two numbers that add up to the target in a sorted array.  

3. [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Find all unique triplets in the array that sum to zero.  

4. *[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Use two pointers to find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  



### Tips for Today:  
- Visualize the problem with examples to better understand the logic.  
- Two pointers usually involve iterating from both ends of the array towards the middle.  
- Use efficient space and time solutions to enhance problem-solving skills.

### **Day 8: Sliding Window Technique**  
Today, you'll focus on **sliding window problems**, which are essential for optimizing solutions that involve subarrays or substrings.

---

1. **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  

2. **[Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray for which the sum is greater than or equal to the target.  

3. **[Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Check if one string is a permutation of a substring of another string.  

4. **[Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)**  
   - Difficulty: Hard  
   - Find the maximum in every sliding window of size `k`.  

---

### Tips for Sliding Window Problems:  
- Start with a brute force approach, then optimize using the sliding window.  
- Focus on maintaining the window boundaries and updating the result as the window slides.  
- Debug with small test cases to understand how the window behaves.

Let me know if you need any help with these problems or want to discuss their solutions!

### **Day 6: Strings (Basics and Manipulations)**  
Today, focus on problems that involve strings and their manipulations. These will help you build a strong foundation for solving string-based problems.


1. **[Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Reverse a string by modifying it in place using two pointers.  

2. **[Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Check if a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces and non-alphanumeric characters.  

3. **[Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Implement the `strStr()` function to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.  

4. **[Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.  

---

### Tips for String Problems:  
- Carefully handle edge cases (e.g., empty strings, single-character strings).  
- Practice using two-pointer techniques for palindrome and reversal problems.  
- Start solving problems step by step: first handle basic logic, then optimize if needed.

### **Day 7: Stack (Basics)**  
Today, you’ll focus on problems that use stacks, a fundamental data structure. These problems will help you understand how to solve problems involving balanced brackets, evaluation of expressions, and more.

---

1. **[Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
   - **Difficulty:** Easy  
   - Check if a string containing `()` `{}` `[]` is valid (each open bracket is closed in the correct order).

2. **[Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)**  
   - **Difficulty:** Medium  
   - Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

3. **[Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)**  
   - **Difficulty:** Medium  
   - Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix).  

4. **[Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)**  
   - Difficulty:** Medium
