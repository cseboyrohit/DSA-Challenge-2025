# DSA-Challenge-2025
Week 1: Arrays & Hashing (Basics)

Memory updated
Understood! Here's a structured DSA practice plan for you, starting from basic to advanced levels:

Week 1: Arrays & Hashing (Basics)
Day 1:
Two Sum
Contains Duplicate
Valid Anagram
Intersection of Two Arrays

Day 2:
Majority Element
Rotate Array
Single Number
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Day 5 & 6 Arrays & Hashing (Intermediate Problems)
Here are your 4 problems for Day 3. These problems will strengthen your understanding of arrays and hashing concepts:

1.Group Anagrams

Difficulty: Medium
Use a hash map to group strings that are anagrams of each other.
Encode and Decode Strings

2.Encode and Decode Strings

Difficulty: Medium
Learn how to encode a list of strings into a single string and decode it back.
Longest Consecutive Sequence

3.Longest Consecutive Sequence

Difficulty: Medium
Use a set to find the longest sequence of consecutive integers in an unsorted array.
Valid Sudoku

4.Valid Sudoku
Difficulty: Medium
Check if a Sudoku board configuration is valid using hashing for rows, columns, and grids.

Day 7: Arrays & Two Pointers 
Today, weâ€™ll focus on problems that help you practice **two-pointer techniques**, a foundational concept in DSA.

1. *[Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)**  
   - Difficulty: Easy  
   - Rearrange the array such that all zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.  

2. *[Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Use the two-pointer technique to find two numbers that add up to the target in a sorted array.  

3. [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Find all unique triplets in the array that sum to zero.  

4. *[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**  
   - Difficulty: Medium  
   - Use two pointers to find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  



### Tips for Today:  
- Visualize the problem with examples to better understand the logic.  
- Two pointers usually involve iterating from both ends of the array towards the middle.  
- Use efficient space and time solutions to enhance problem-solving skills.  

Let me know if you need help with any of these problems or their concepts!
